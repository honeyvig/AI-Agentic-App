# AI-Agentic-App
We are building an AI Agentic App that has extensive ML models. We have built the MVP, which is now in production and has proven to be successful.

However, there is still work to be done.  We are now building a fully workable product (this phase is kicking off now) which is the focus.

Your role will be required to be hands-on in the entire AI architecture build and testing. You will also work with- two junior ML engineers, a senior data scientist, and a senior data engineer.

What is expected?
I am looking for someone who can spend at least 20-30 hours per week focussing on the architecture buildout of AI applications with agentic capability, experimentation and research.

You must have:
- Built AI agents and workflows
- Have ML / Production experience
- Launched products in the past
- Built APIs
==================
To develop a AI Agentic App with extensive ML models, we need to approach this systematically, focusing on both AI architecture and the integration of the core ML models for agentic capabilities. Below is an outline of the key components of the system, followed by Python code that you can use as a foundational framework for AI agent development, model deployment, and experimentation.
Key Components for AI Agentic App:

    AI Architecture Buildout:
        Develop a robust architecture with clear modular components (ML model handling, data pipeline, API integration).
        Design for scalability, as we need to incorporate complex ML workflows and agent interactions.
        Integration of multiple ML models (e.g., NLP, recommendation systems, RL agents).

    ML Model and Workflow Design:
        ML models should include agentic capabilities (such as decision-making, autonomy, etc.).
        Focus on creating efficient pipelines for experimentation and research.
        Continuous model improvement based on feedback from the production environment.

    APIs and Integration:
        Expose ML models through well-documented REST APIs.
        Ensure seamless data flow and interaction between models, users, and the rest of the application.
        Consider implementing real-time communication and agent interaction logic.

    Testing and Monitoring:
        Set up robust testing for agent workflows and model performance (unit tests, integration tests, etc.).
        Implement monitoring for model performance (e.g., accuracy, runtime efficiency).

    Collaboration with Junior Engineers:
        Provide mentorship and guidance to junior engineers to help them contribute to the overall architecture buildout.
        Encourage experimentation and research-driven development for improved models.

Python Framework for Building AI Agentic Application:

Below is a simplified Python framework that shows how to organize AI agents, ML models, and APIs using the Flask web framework, along with experimentation pipelines.

import logging
import json
import requests
from flask import Flask, jsonify, request
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
import numpy as np
from transformers import pipeline

# Set up logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(message)s')

# Initialize Flask App
app = Flask(__name__)

# Example of loading and using a pre-trained model (for NLP or other tasks)
nlp_model = pipeline('sentiment-analysis')

# Mock function for agent decision-making based on ML model output
def agent_decision(input_text):
    logging.info("Processing input for agent decision...")
    
    # Get sentiment from the input text
    sentiment = nlp_model(input_text)
    decision = "Proceed" if sentiment[0]['label'] == 'POSITIVE' else "Hold"
    
    logging.info(f"Sentiment: {sentiment[0]['label']} - Decision: {decision}")
    return decision

# Model Training (Simulation)
def train_model(data):
    logging.info("Training ML Model...")
    
    # Split data into training and test sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(data['features'], data['labels'], test_size=0.3, random_state=42)
    
    # Create and train a simple model (for illustration)
    model = SomeMachineLearningModel()
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    
    # Evaluate model
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
    
    logging.info(f"Model accuracy: {accuracy}")
    return model

# Endpoint for interacting with the agent
@app.route('/agent', methods=['POST'])
def agent_action():
    data = request.get_json()
    
    # Perform decision-making based on agent logic
    user_input = data.get('input')
    decision = agent_decision(user_input)
    
    # Return response with the decision
    response = {
        'decision': decision
    }
    return jsonify(response)

# Endpoint to trigger model training (for experimentation purposes)
@app.route('/train', methods=['POST'])
def trigger_training():
    data = request.get_json()
    
    # Simulate a data structure for model training
    model = train_model(data)
    
    response = {
        'status': 'Training completed successfully',
        'model_accuracy': model.accuracy
    }
    return jsonify(response)

# Endpoint to retrieve current model's performance or agent behavior
@app.route('/status', methods=['GET'])
def get_status():
    status = {
        'model_status': 'Trained and operational',
        'current_agent_decision': 'Pending user input for decision'
    }
    return jsonify(status)

# Experimentation Pipeline (simplified for illustration)
def experimentation_pipeline():
    logging.info("Starting experimentation pipeline...")
    
    # Data preprocessing and model training
    data = load_data()  # Assume we have a data loading function
    trained_model = train_model(data)
    
    # Evaluate agent's decision-making behavior
    agent_input = "The product launch was successful"
    agent_decision_output = agent_decision(agent_input)
    
    logging.info(f"Agent decision based on experiment: {agent_decision_output}")

# AI Agent Simulation for Autonomy and Decision Making
class AI_Agent:
    def __init__(self, agent_id):
        self.agent_id = agent_id
        self.status = "Idle"
    
    def process_input(self, input_text):
        decision = agent_decision(input_text)
        self.status = "Processed"
        logging.info(f"Agent {self.agent_id} decision: {decision}")
        return decision

    def trigger_action(self, action_input):
        logging.info(f"Triggering agent action with input: {action_input}")
        # Implement custom agent workflow logic
        return self.process_input(action_input)

# Running the Application (for testing purposes)
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

Code Explanation:

    Flask Web Application:
        Flask is used to create a simple API server that can handle requests to trigger agent actions or model training.
        There are three main endpoints:
            /agent for triggering agent decisions based on user input (this represents agent autonomy).
            /train for training ML models (simulation of an experiment).
            /status for getting the status of the model or agent.

    AI Agent:
        An AI_Agent class is implemented to represent an intelligent agent capable of processing input and making decisions. The process_input function simulates decision-making based on the AI model's output (e.g., NLP sentiment analysis).

    Model Training:
        The train_model function illustrates a mock pipeline to train an ML model on some provided data.

    Experimentation Pipeline:
        The experimentation_pipeline function provides an example of how you can experiment with different workflows and models in your AI architecture, such as testing agent behavior and training ML models.

    Integration with ML Models:
        A pre-trained NLP model (from HuggingFace's transformers library) is used to determine sentiment from input text and base agent decisions on this analysis.

To Implement and Scale:

    Real-time Communication: This framework can be extended to include real-time communication between agents or components using message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) for asynchronous workflows.
    Deployment: For scalability, this Flask app can be containerized using Docker and deployed in cloud environments like AWS, GCP, or Azure. Kubernetes can be used for orchestration.
    Advanced Experimentation: Integrate a model management system (like MLflow) to track experiments, models, and hyperparameters.
    Agent Autonomy: Implement more complex agent decision logic and autonomous workflows, using reinforcement learning or rule-based systems, depending on the use case.

Key Responsibilities Addressed:

    Architecture Build: This code provides a foundation for building the architecture, handling API endpoints, ML models, and agent workflows.
    ML & Production Experience: The code includes elements of model training, experimentation, and agent-based decision-making.
    APIs: REST APIs are implemented to facilitate integration with other systems.

With this structure, you can build the full agent-based AI system while experimenting with various AI models and workflows, ensuring continuous iteration and improvement in the application.
